    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><strong>Leave the cows alone!</strong> Team up with oats for a perfect alternative.</p>
        <p>With little more than oats and water, you can craft your very own oat milk at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup whole rolled oats</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons maple syrup</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon sea salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the oats, water, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt in a blender and blend for 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the milk without pushing any excess pulp through the strainer. This will create a creamier texture thatâ€™s not gritty or gummy.</li>
            <li>Add more maple syrup, to taste, if desired. Chill overnight. If you want to drink your oat milk right away, I recommend adding ice - it's flavor is best when well chilled.</li>
        </ol>
